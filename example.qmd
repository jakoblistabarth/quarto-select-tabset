That's how regular tabset look like:

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Dresden

Tab content on Dresden.

### Berlin

Berlin has a tab pane as well.

This is how a similar component controlled by a select looks like.

::: {.panel-select option-label="Select a city â€¦"}

### Dresden

Dresden Content. With some paragraphs.

And even a code chunck!

```{r}
#| label: test-chunk
print("test")
```

### Berlin

The second tab pane is all about Berlin.

### Munich

This is the 3rd pane. Munich content goes here.

::: {.panel-select}

### Dresden

A second time a tab pane with the same name to test for possible conflicts.

### Berlin
